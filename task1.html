<h2>Pre arrival Tasks</h2>
<div class="leftbox">
<p>To start you on that journey of exploration we would like you to complete the following tasks prior to coming to university. These will help you with your first assessment and are relevant to your first few lectures so please take time to do these to the best of your ability.</p>
</div>
<h2>Task 1</h2>
<ol><li>Select an event of international or national importance from the last three years. As we are studying Psychology, try to choose an event that relates to human behaviour; for example, you might choose an event about wildfires spreading, but instead of focusing on the spread of the fires, you would focus on the psychological impact of the fires</li>
<li>Read some news articles about your chosen event (online or paper editions), try to use sources you would not normally consider. A good goal would be to read three to five articles from a number of sources. You could also watch or listen to the news (Channel 4 has some good in-depth news programmes). Finally, you could also read articles from general Psychology publications that relate to your event. For instance, you could consider articles in The Psychologist <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/archive">(https://www.bps.org.uk/archive)</a> or Psychology Today <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb">(https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb)</a></li>
<li> Once you have read more broadly, narrow down to a single article that interests you about your chosen event and makes you ask “why?”. Then write a short paragraph (around 300 words or so) which answers the following questions:
<li>What made you choose this particular article, for example what behaviours are reported?</li>
<li>How do you think Psychology can help you understand the event better?</li></li>
<li>Bring a hard copy of your article to your first tutorial (week commencing 2nd October)</li></ol>
