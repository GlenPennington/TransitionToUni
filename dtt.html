<h1>What does it mean?</h1>
<p>Transition to university refers to adjusting and adapting to the academic, social, and personal changes that occur when a student begins their higher education. Transition involves a shift from the structured and familiar environment of school or previous educational settings to a more independent and autonomous learning experience</p>



<div class="leftbox"><div class="strongwhite">During this period, students typically encounter various changes and opportunities including:</div><br><br>
<div class="strongwhite">Increased Independence:</div>
<p>
At University you will have a lot more control over your schedules, course selection, and overall academic experience. Of course you will have timetabled sessions, but a considerable amount of your learning will take place outside of the classroom or lecture theatre.</p>
<p>You will want to learn to manage your time eff ectively, set priorities, and seek assistance when needed. Knowing when to ask for help is a crucial stage in the process, and your personal tutor will have dedicated contact time allotted for academic support and general signposting to Hope resources.</p>
<p>The take home message about increased independence is that it is really important to find a balance between your academic and social life.</p></div>

<br><p><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong></p>
<p>Some of you will be moving away from home for the first time, and you may find this liberating. You might be adjusting to new living arrangements, managing your own finances for the first time, cooking for yourself and learning how to live with strangers. If you live on campus, there is a Residential Life Team who can help with all things practical and social. You can follow them on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/lhu_residential_life/</p>

<p>Some of you will live locally, or be commuting to campus and are likely to have different responsibilities. You might be balancing a job, families, and personal or caring responsibilities. The university seeks to be inclusive and support all students. No matter your background, your reason for study, where you live, or the course you are taking, the Students Union is here to support you

<p><strong>Social Environment</strong></p>
<p>University provides unique opportunities to meet new people from diverse backgrounds. Building new friendships, participating in extracurricular activities, and engaging in campus life contributes to personal growth and development. Hope has a vibrant student community, and during your first few weeks there will be many opportunities to ease yourself into this new social world. At the Fresher’s Fair you will find out about the societies that currently exist, and how to create a new society if the one you are interested in does not already exist! Obviously, we’d love our students to be part of an active Psychology Society!</p>

</div><strong>Academic Life</strong></p><p>It is likely that you will be introduced to new ways of learning, along with different teaching styles, academic standards, and most importantly self-directed learning.
Self-directed learning means that students learn independently in and outside of the classroom. Instead of creating a strict teaching plan, we allow students to take responsibility for their learning by making goals, improving their skills and making decisions on where, what, when and how they learn. Self-directed study allows students to learn with autonomy, developing essential skills valuable for study and employability.
We help to facilitate self-directed learning by embedding good working practices into your studies from the start.</p>
