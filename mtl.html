<h1>What is Academic Motivation?</h1>

<p><img src="images/Motivation.png" align="right">Academic motivation is the drive, desire, and willingness that you have to engage in learning and educational activities. It can be characterised as the internal or external factors that stimulate and sustain your interest, effort, and persistence in your academic studies. Academic motivation plays a crucial role in your educational journey as it influences your level of engagement, goal-setting, and even your overall academic achievement. </p>



<div class="leftbox"><div class="strongwhite">Academic Motivation</div>

<p>You can complete a questionnaire called the Academic Motivation Scale (also known as the AMS)by scanning the QR code. The purpose of this questionnaire is to gather some information about your thoughts about your study habits, learning skills, and your attitudes and approaches to study. If you complete this scale we will provide you with feedback from the AMS on each of the dimensions of the scale. </p>
</div><p>Here we describe how to interpret your scores, so you can figure out what your personal scores mean. The AMS measures seven aspects of academic motivation and you were asked to respond on a scale of 1 - 7 with the headings of ‘does not correspond at all’ (1) to ‘corresponds exactly’ (7). The minimum score you could get on the total scale is 4 and the maximum score is 28. In all aspects except for Amotivation, a higher score is better.</p>
<h3>Intrinsic Motivation</h3>
<ul><li>to know - the motivation you have for learning simply to know, enjoy and be satisfied by understanding new things</li>
<li>for accomplishment - for the purpose of accomplishment, enjoying the sense of achievement, satisfaction from good grades</li>
<li>for the experience - to feel stimulated, happy, excited by the new experiences</li></ul>

<h3>Extrinsic Motivation</h3>
<ul><li>identified - you recognise the importance of the learning to achieve goals</li>
<li>introjected- to prove to yourself that you can do something, for the feeling of importance</li>
<li>external - for external reward, such as higher earning power, career motivation</li></ul>

<h3>Amotivation</h3>
<ul><li>lack of motivation – the experience of having little or no motivation to learn or study</li></ul>

<h1>Interpreting your score</h1>

<p>Average scores for males and females from a sample of 745 people are shown in the table below.</p>
<small>Table 1. Average scores of Males and Females on the Academic Motivation Scale from Vallerand, et al. (1992)</small>

<table>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Males (n=261)</th><th>Females n = (484)</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">Intrinsic Motivation</td></tr>
<tr><td>to know</td><td>18.89</td><td>20.46</td></tr>
<tr><td>for accomplishment</td><td>15.93</td><td>17.52</td></tr>
<tr><td>for experience</td><td>12.21</td><td>13.83</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">Extrinsic Motivation</td></tr>
<tr><td>identified</td><td>21.60</td><td>22.19</td></tr>
<tr><td>introjected</td><td>16.00</td><td>17.80</td></tr>
<tr><td>external regulation</td><td>21.78</td><td>21.80</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">Amotivation</td></tr>
<tr><td>lack of motivation</td><td>6.74</td><td>7.51</td></tr></table>
<p>We would expect that your scores would be similar to the mean (average) scores in Table 1. Remember the lowest score on each aspect is 4, and the highest is 28. If you have a low score on Intrinsic or Extrinsic Motivation, there are some suggestions below for you to consider.</p>
<p>If you have a high score on Amotivation you may want think about your reasons for wanting to go to university and follow some of the suggestions below, as motivation is something that can be improved when nurtured. This information is intended to help you determine your own motivation and approach to academic studies, but also identify possible areas for improvement. You may want to use this feedback to be proactive about improving your motivation or approach to learning.</p><p> All the attitude and approaches to study skills mentioned on your feedback sheet are learnable. This is an important idea to remember, especially when at university.</p>
<p>We have provided some hints to go along with each primary dimension. We hope you find these suggestions helpful. But keep in mind that these are not the only ways to improve each area. Allowing yourself this time and space to reflect on your motivations will help you to focus on where you feel you will benefit most. There are no clear rights or wrongs in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, however it is good to aim to strike a balance between the two.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Intrinsic Motivation</h2>
<p>There are benefits and drawbacks to each aspect of motivation. Some of the benefits of being intrinsically motivated are:</p>
<ul><li>Intrinsic Motivation is not dependent on external rewards</li>
<li>Intrinsic Motivation relates positively to learning and achievement</li>
<li>Individuals who score higher in Intrinsic Motivation are more likely to actively participate in class discussion</li>
<li>Those high in Intrinsic Motivation tend to have the ability to organise new knowledge and relate it to existing knowledge</li>
<li>They also tend to have an ability to apply skills and knowledge to reality</li></ul>
<p>There are also some possible drawbacks to being highly intrinsically motivated:</p>
<ul><li>You can sometimes lose track of time and space when working on a task You may tend to focus on the tasks you enjoy most</li>
<li>Leaving you not enough time to learn or perform other required tasks</li></ul>
<h3>Things to think about</h3>
<p>If your intrinsic motivation scores are average or above average, then you have little to be concerned about. You will typically exhibit the kind of traits that we see in highly engaged students. However, to avoid the pitfalls of extremely high intrinsic motivation you may want to consider how you approach the myriad of tasks that you want to do. Planning and short-term goal setting for learning is a good way to manage your time effectively. This will allow you to switch focus to other important tasks, self-care, and having fun.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Extrinsic Motivation</h2>
<p>Some of the benefits of being extrinsically motivated are:</p>
<ul><li>You may be keen to learn in order to earn high grades or for your career goals</li><li> You may be competitive with peers in your learning experience</li>
<li>You are likely to compete for tangible rewards (e.g. honours and awards)</li>
<li>You will have high performance goals and possible high expectations of yourself</li></ul>
<p>There are also some possible disadvantages to being highly extrinsically motivated:</p>
<ul><li>Your goals tend to be long-term goals and you are focussed on the ‘prize’ rather than the experience</li>
<li>If there is no reward you may be less likely to participate in a task</li>
<li>May be less likely to engage in cooperative behaviour (group work)</li></ul>
<h3>Things to think about</h3>
<p>If your extrinsic motivation scores are around the average, then you are in a good position to start. Most of us have a degree of extrinsic motivations in our careers! It is not ideal however if you are low in intrinsic motivation, but extremely high in extrinsic motivation. If all your motivations for learning are dominated by external factors and rewards, you may experience stress when you achieve less than you would like.</p>
<p>To steer clear of the drawbacks of extremely high extrinsic motivation you may want to think about the following.</p>
<ul><li>Try to reframe your goals to personalise them, as opposed to externalising</li><li> Listen to praise when it is given</li> <li>Work with your peers to support one another</li> </ul>
<p>During the year you will have opportunities for formative feedback and the reward for participating in exercises with formative feedback is the extra support or advice that will help you to excel on your assessments.</p>
<p>This advice also applies to reading and preparing for classes, you will get a sense of satisfaction when you understand the subject in a more deep and meaningful way. You will be ready to ask questions, and you will feel more confident in your studies.</p>
<hr><h2>Amotivation</h2>
<p>In the next section we will discuss amotivation, however many of the tips and suggestions will apply to all students, so please do read on, and see if any of these resonate with you to identify areas where you can develop.</p>
<p>As you can see in Table 1. typical students will have a low score on this dimension. A high score of anything above 12 suggests that you are having issues with your motivation for academic learning. Often amotivation is also something you will be experiencing outside of your academic studies, so you may also feel amotivated in other areas of your life.</p>
<h3>Things to think about</h3>
<p>Firstly, it is important to identify any external factors that might be affecting your motivation. You may be having doubts about the course, or yourself, you may be unwell or have pressures that are preventing you focussing on your academic goals. If you can pinpoint a factor, then that can direct you to sources of help.</p>
 
<p>Course and Career Suggestions:</p>
<p>For career related wobbles it would be a good idea to seek support from a career advisor, or a trusted previous tutor. Being better informed about your choices will increase your sense of autonomy, and this in turn can impact motivation in a positive way.<p>
<p>Study Skills Suggestions:</p>
<p>You may be experiencing a wobble in your confidence, which is completely normal. The shift from school or previous education to university is a big transition. There are things that you can do to support the development of your motivation here too. For example, a psychology course related activity that you can try to help improve your motivation is to buy or loan from a library, a course textbook. We recommend:
Schacter, D., Gilbert, D., Wegner, D., & Hood, B. M. (2019). Psychology : Third European Edition. Macmillan International Higher Education.</p>
<p>You can buy introductory Psychology books second hand, or visit your local library to access text books. Just make sure they are printed in the last five years as psychology is a very dynamic discipline. Humans respond to the environment and circumstances around them, and new knowledge and research can change the way we think about things and how we behave.</p><p>A good example of this is the explosion of artifical intelligence in daily life. The technology is marching on apace and we are only at the beginning of our understanding of the impact of artificial intelligence and how people and society may respond, react, and change.</p>
<p>Back to the text book, skim the table of contents of the textbook and make a list of the three topics that most interest you and of the three topics that least interest you. Pay particular attention to these topics.</p>
<ul><li>What is it about the three most interesting topics that makes you like them so much?</li>
<li>What is it about the other three topics that make them unappealing to you?</li>
<li>Can you find any of the characteristics of the three most interesting topics in the three least interesting topics?</li></ul>
<p>If you identify what it is about the three most interesting topics that make you like them so much, you may be able to apply what you found to the three least interesting ones, and perhaps you'll find that those uninteresting topics aren't so uninteresting after all!</p>
<p>An added bonus that comes from developing better study skills is that it usually results in lower levels of anxiety and an increased sense of autonomy and feeling of being prepared.
Prepare well for the class and plan your schedule effectively
Try not to wait until the last minute to get things done.</p>
<p>Remind yourself that you've prepared well and if you are having difficulty with a topic or concept, you can bet that at least one other person in the room will be feeling the same way as you do.
Try to connect with groups set up for Freshers, there are usually Facebook or WhatsApp groups set up by students, for students. This may help build a sense of excitement for the experience Use a journal to note down at least one positive thing each day, no matter how big or small.</p>

<p>Ask for help when you need it, from peers, lecturers, university support systems, your family, or friends, or even your GP!</p>
<h3>Remember that amotivation is a temporary state and it can be overcome</h3>
