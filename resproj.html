<h2>Research Information Sheet</h2>
<h3>Outline of the research: </h3>
<p>This project looks at how students engage with tasks provided to help them understand their aptitudes, motivations and emotions in relation to study. We are also interested in what incoming students think about the transition to university, and their emotions and subsequent academic outcomes. </p>

<h3>Research Team:</h3>
<ul><li>Dr Glen Pennington</li><li>Prof. Nick Donnelly</li><li>Dr Julienne McGeough</li></ul>
<p>The Principal Investigator of this study can be contacted by email at penning@hope.ac.uk</p>

<h3>Institution and Eligibility:</h3> 
<p>Liverpool Hope University. To be eligible to take part in this study you should be a student of Psychology (Single Honours, Joint Honours; i.e.Psychology with another subject, or in Foundation Year)</p>

<h3>What will my participation in the research involve?</h3>
<p>As a part of a departmental induction process we will be sending by email a short series of activities for students to complete.  These have been created to support your transition to university life. Each activity focuses on an aspect of the move to becoming an independent learner.<br> Everyone who completes the activities will receive a brief email with their scores and a handy booklet with some hints and tips related to each activity.</p> 
<p>You are not obliged to take part in the research to take advantage of the activities and resources, but if you choose to participate we will ask you some more questions about you.</p>
<p>With your permission, we will use your activity scores and academic outcomes (your marks in coursework and exams) later in the academic year to help inform the curriculum and consider the aptitudes, motivations and emotions around transition to university and academic outcomes.</p>

<h3>Will there be any benefits to me to taking part?</h3>
<p></p>Each activity you complete will provide some information designed to support your transition to university. <br>
The online package includes 5 short modules which cover the following topics: 

<ol><li>Welcome and transition to university, including information and consent to the study</li><li>Motivations for studying at Higher Education</li><li>Confidence and self-efficacy</li> <li>Independent learning, including academic self-regulation </li><li>Summary and skills audit</li></ol>

<p>You will receive this benefit irrespective of consent to use your data for the purposes specified.</p>
<p>If you choose to take part in the study, we will also measure your resilience, your propensity for being proactive, your academic self efficacy, mathematics anxiety as previous research has indicated that these are all factors involved in the transition to university.</p>
<h3>Will there be any risks to me in taking part?</h3>

<p>There are no known risks, however, if any of the information that you receive causes you concern or you would like further explanation, you should contact Dr Pennington (penning@hope.ac.uk) who will be available for support.</p>

<h3>What happens if I decide that I donâ€™t want to take part during the actual research study, or decide that the information given should not be used?</h3>

<p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at any point during the study. You will be asked to provide an easy to recall alphanumeric code and you will be reminded of this via email. If you wish to withdraw you may use this code in order that the researcher can remove your data.</p>
<h3>How will you ensure that my contribution is anonymous? </h3>
<p>If you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked your name and student number in order that we can access your academic outcomes (grades). However this identifying information will be separated from the responses to the questions prior to data analysis and participants will only be identified by the alphanumeric code specified above. Only the named researcher (Dr Glen Pennington: penning@hope.ac.uk) will have access to the data, and this data will be securely held on a password protected server.</p>
<h3>Ethical Approval:</h3>
<p>Ethical approval has been granted by the Liverpool Hope Ethics Board</p>
