<h1>What is Academic Self-Regulation?</h1>

<p><img src="images/SelfRegulation.png" align="right">Academic self-regulation (ASR) is defined as your own thoughts, feelings, and actions that are focused on attaining goals you have set for yourself. Students who are self-regulated learners tend to be proactive in their efforts to learn, primarily because they are aware of their strengths and limitations and because they are guided by personally set goals and task-related strategies.</p>

<p>The ASR scale that you can reach by scanning the QR code gives you a sense of awareness about your individual self- regulation and accountability for your own learning. As you can see from the results provided in your email, there are seven elements that the author believes make up Academic Self-Regulation.</p>
<ul><li>Memory Strategy – the strategies that you use to help you to remember and learn</li>
<li>Goal Setting – the short-term learning goals you put in place</li>
<li>Self-Evaluation – your ability to accept feedback from different sources, and to acknowledge the areas where you can improve</li>
<li>Seeking Help – asking your tutors, your peers, and support staff for help when you feel that you need it</li>
<li>Environmental Regulation – the strategies that you use in your learning environment to help you to focus your attention on the tasks that you need to complete</li>
<li>Learning Responsibility - your priorities in terms of your own learning, your ability to check work against criteria set and ensure that it is of an acceptable standard before submission Organising – how you choose to work, are you methodical or chaotic?</li></ul>

<h3>Interpreting your score</h3>
<p>Magno (2010) asked 309 participants to complete the ASR scale. The minimum score is 1, and the maximum score is 4. If you score 1 to 1.5 on any of the components of the ASR, this will indicate that your own thoughts, feelings, and actions are lower than average on that part of the scale. </p><p>If you score highly on any of the ASR subscales, then this indicates you believe that you have positive strategies in
place to support your own learning in those aspects of self-regulation. We expect that most students will score close to the averages shown in the table below. </p>
<p>Remember that academic self-regulation is something that you can develop over time with some of the strategies we suggest below.</p>

<h3> Developing Academic Self-Regulation</h3>
<p>In a society with a million and one distractions competing for your attention and focus, it can be a challenge to regulate your own behaviour to focus on your learning goals. In order to get the best outcomes, you will likely need to work on your own self-regulation in relation to your learning.</p>
<p>Self-regulation <strong>is not</strong> a cognitive ability, or an academic performance skill. It is the self-directed process by which you transform your cognitive abilities into academic skills. Self-regulation is also a valuable process in employability. Employers favour individuals who are high in self-regulation, and those individuals tend to progress well in their desired field.</p>
<p>Based upon this you will be able to see how it is worth investing time in nurturing your own academic self-regulation. Below are some ideas about how you can work to develop and refine your self- regulation skills.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Thinking abiout thinking</h2>
<p>Before you put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard consider the task that you must complete, set achievable bite-sized goals, and plan strategically how you will achieve these goals.</p>

 
<ul><li>Pace yourself and be proactive with your time management</li>
<li> Organise and transform any guidance provided</li> 
<li>Understand how the task will be marked or graded</li></ul>
<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<p>Are you clear about what is expected of you?</p>
<ul><li>Have you read the guidance and marking criteria?</li>
<li>Discuss different approaches to the task with your peers as you can all benefit from the insight of other people</li>
<li>Vocalise your thoughts with others, talking through ideas can help you to organise your thoughts How interested are you in the topic? </li>
<li>How can you increase your interest to help to motivate you? </li>
<li>What knowledge/skills do you want to learn or consolidate from this task beyond obtaining a grade?</li>
<li>What are your expectations of the outcome? Are they realistic?</li></ul>

<hr>
<h2>Thinking about doing</h2>
<p>When engaging with the task can you visualise what you want to achieve? Now you must apply self- control and attentional focus to the task</p>
<ul><li>Keep notes about literature that is useful to your task, and also a brief note for any papers that are not useful to save yourself time revisiting things that are not of use</li>
<li>You can outline a research study or summarise in a bit more detail. You will need to rearrange materials to suit the requirements of the task</li>
<li>Use tools such as highlighting, flashcards/index cards, draw pictures, diagrams, charts or use webs/mind mapping</li>
<li>Use drafts and sensible file names rather than editing a single document. This ensures you will always have a back-up and will know which draft you should be working from</li>
<li>Find information from appropriate sources, journals, textbooks etc.</li>
<li>Learn how to search the library and the internet effectively. There will be lots of guidance on this during your first year of studies, take advantage of opportunities to support effective research skills</li>
<li>Seek assistance from social sources, peers, lecturers, the library, learning mentors etc</li>
<li>Remember to take regular breaks and give yourself treats to incentivise yourself</li></ul>
<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<p>What kind of memory strategies will be most useful to you in your learning? Some people like visual strategies such as mind maps, some like to use text-based bullet journals, and others find that colour coding often helps organise thoughts. There are so many strategies you can use to support your learning, find something that works for you</p>
<ul><li>Find your method and refine it over time</li>
<li>Remember that it’s ok to switch methods according to the task</li>
<li>What is your study environment like? Is it adequate for your own needs? Make observations about yourself while engaged with a task</li>
<li>What kind of things distracted you?</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Thinking about how it went</h2>
<p>Once the task is complete you should always take some time to reflect. This is not the time to be judging your performance on a task, but to identify any aspects of good practice and any areas that were problematic, and why.</p>
<p>Remember this is not about being overly critical, but about recognising where improvements can be made</p>
<ul><li>List any errors made so that you avoid repeating them, carefully read feedback on assessments, and ask for advice or clarity if needed</li>
<li>Recognising when you need support and asking for it is vital to your studies</li></ul>
<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<Ul><li>Do not attribute bumps in the road to ‘fixed ability’, use them as a learning experience, ask questions if you don’t understand and take that information with you in a positive way</li>
<li>Reflect upon and make notes about any skills or knowledge gained as a result of the task, and any subsequent feedback</li></ul>
<p>
How do you think that you can apply this to your studies?</p>
<h3>Remember:</h3>
<p>Improving academic self-regulation takes time and patience. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate every small (or large!) success along the way.</p>
