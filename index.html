<p>On behalf of all staff in the Department of Psychology, I would like to welcome you to the University. As you can see from the resources in this microsite, an undergraduate degree requires you to become an independent learner and we want to see you take ownership of your work and your time. Be prepared to work collaboratively with your peers and approach your studies in a respectful, responsible manner.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to engage in self-evaluation as this helps us to achieve our best. It will allow you to track the development of key skills, be responsive to feedback, and gain confidence in asking questions and discussing.</p> <p>The lecturers and support staff are here to help and guide you through your studies and we aim to provide an enriching and fulfilling academic experience that enables you to achieve your goals. The more you put into your degree, the more rewarding it will be, so engage fully, be open to new experiences, and take advantage of every opportunity. Most of all, enjoy your time at university!</p>
<p>I wish you every success in your degree.</p>
<h2>Dr Catherine Thompson</h2>
